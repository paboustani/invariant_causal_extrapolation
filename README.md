## Towards Invariant Causal Extrapolation: A Framework for Out-of-Support Causal Inference

### Abstract
Defining a comprehensive framework for causal relationships in the tails of a causal system is still a subject to open research. With our work, we aim to bridge the gap between causal discovery methods developed for the bulk of a distribution and those developed for its tails by utilizing causal inference through state-of-the-art extrapolation techniques. To this end, we introduce the framework of invariant causal extrapolation, which consists of a pre-additive noise model in conjunction with a distributional single-index regression, allowing to infer interpretable coefficients while flexibly modelling a wide range of causal link functions. In this thesis, we develop a concise notion of causal extrapolation, integrate our methodology into the existing literature, and conduct comprehensive empirical validation. The successful integration of our framework could lead to significant advances in fields that rely on the causal analysis of extreme events, such as climate science or risk management.
